# super-repl

## Uses Repl.it and Headless Browser to gain the power of a super computer!

### We've created a single super-repl. You run a master node (on repl.it), then create slave nodes using your computer and a script (that also run on repl.it). All of these nodes execute the same code that is requested from the master node, and can be easily enabled/disabled by the master node.
