## Uses Repl.it and Headless Browser to gain the power of a super computer!

#### We've created a single super-repl. You run a master node (run on repl.it), then generate slave nodes (also run on repl.it). All of these nodes execute the same code that is received from the master node. The system can be easily modified by a simple API update.
